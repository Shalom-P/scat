introduction:

1)domain machine learning 
   ---python is a tool which we use to implement machine learning
 note: points relevent to how we are going to use in our project


introduction to tpoic our project title
some points to cover--
1)our project is divided into two parts
        1. data collection(this includes cleaning the data aslo)
        2. traing the machine learning model and finding the most effecient
            model for our use case.
1..data collection--
    -we take a news related sentence and compare it to verified news channels 
      reported headlines on that particular topic.
      with the help of youtube..
      (note: just understand how it works......)  
2..training the model--
   -using the data collected preciously we train and an effecient model
     to give us the desired output(i.e. to tell if a news related sentence is true or      not)


problem statement:::
to analyse a news related statement and to come to a conclusion if it is true or not by using real time verified data.
